FrontPanel/USB QNX API
======================
This release of the FrontPanel QNX API is BETA.  There are no known problems.
FrontPanel/PCIe is not supported on QNX at this time.

To receive the QNX FrontPanel shared object (libokFrontPanel.so), please send
your request to support@opalkelly.com.  Please include as much information as
you can about your project:
  + QNX version
  + CPU Architecture
  + Project description
  + Opal Kelly board you are using (e.g. XEM6010-LX45)
  + Hardware platform (full vendor and part name)


Release architectures:
======================
QNX Version            CPU Architecture      Tested Platform
-----------            ----------------      ---------------
QNX Neutrino 6.5.0     x86                   VMWare Workstation
QNX Neutrino 6.5.0     x86 / Atom            Advantech PCM-9562


Additional Architecture Support:
================================
Opal Kelly is capable of developing and supporting additional architectures
or platforms for FrontPanel QNX.  If your organization requires additional
QNX support, the general terms and process is as follows:

   1. Contact sales@opalkelly.com with the details.  Be sure to include as
      much information as you can:
      + QNX version
      + CPU architecture
      + Specific platform (include a link!) for testing and development

   2. If a library has not already been provided for that platform, you 
      will need to provide a reference platform to us for development.
      This must include:
      + All required hardware for development from a standard Windows-based
        development environment such as QNX Momentix.
      + All required power supply or interface connections.
      + Any additional software or tools required.

   3. If Opal Kelly is unable to provide platform support for any reason,
      we will return your hardware to you.

   4. If Opal Kelly is able to complete the port, we keep all hardware and
      whatever software licenses are current and required.
