This file provides an extremely simple and brief explanation of card synchronization. For a much more complete description, refer to the manual for Cicero.

How to synchronize two cards:

In this example, Dev1 is a digital output card, and Dev 2 in an analog output card. 

Server settings:
   set the Trigger output to "/dev1/port1/line0"
   
   Wire port 1 line 0 of the digital output card to PFI2 of the digital output card, and to PFI0 of the analog output card.
   
   set the trigger in port for Dev1 to pfi2
   set the trigger in port for Dev2 to pfi0
   
   Viola, you should now have synchronized starting of tasks on different devices. Note, since these instructions were written, it has occured to me that the same can be acccomplished
   without needing any physical wiring, through use of the daqmx "connections" features.
   
 
 Next step: synchronize their clocks:
    Set the master timebase source for both devices to PXI_Trig7.
    In the server's list of daqmx "connections", connect FROM /dev1/20MHzTimeBase TO /dev1/pxi_trig7.
 
 
   
   Remaining mysteries: 
     - If the sample clocks of the two devices are different, then despite this triggering method they will be offset by a time on the order of the slower clock.
      ( compare to sync to ~ 1 us otherwise).
